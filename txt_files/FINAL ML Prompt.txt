FINAL ML Prompt
Here's the updated prompt:

---

**Task:** Create a machine learning regression model in R (RStudio) to predict exam scores from 40 features.

**Data specifications:**
- Original: 13 categorical variables, 6 continuous variables, 1 target (exam scores)
- Categorical variables: One-hot encoded into 34 binary columns (0/1)
- Continuous variables: Mean-standardized (6 columns)
- Total feature columns: 40
- Dataset: Pre-cleaned with no whitespace
- Train/test split: 80/20 (train data provided in CSV)

**Model requirements:**
1. Algorithm: Gradient descent with L2 regularization
2. Cost function: Regularized mean squared error
3. Iterations: 1000 (fixed)
4. Parameter updates: Simultaneous (vectorized) for all weights and intercept
5. Isolated target feature "Exam_Score" to ensure no data leakage. 
6. alpha learning rate = .01
7. lamba = 1
8 interations = 1000

**Output requirements:**
1. Learning curve plot: Cost vs. iterations
2. Contour plot: Gradient descent path to minimum
3. Final RMSE or cost associated with model. I want to know how well the model is doing. 

**Critical:** Use vectorized operations to ensure all parameters update simultaneously in each iteration.

EDITS:
NOTE: All of this is the manual calculation in base R
you dont have to create or do any one hot coding it is already done I was just making you aware of it

have both the learning curve and contour plot be plot in the R Studio Plot section
